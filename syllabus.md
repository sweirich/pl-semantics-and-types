## Grading and Assignments

* **Participation (10%)**: This is a new, experimental class and everyone in
the class will be co-developers. As a result, you are expected to actively
contribute. This mainly means being a part of the lectures by ask questions,
thinking about puzzles, participating in the discussion, and generally
volunteering your insights and reactions. You can also participate by chatting
during office hours or submitting pull-requests on the lecture notes. Let me
know if you are sick or otherwise need to miss class.

* **Homework (40%)**: There will be approximately five homework assignments
throughout the semester. These will involve written proofs, with
opportunities for machine assistance. These assignments are designed to
solidify your understanding of the core concepts.

* **Midterm Exam (20%)**: 90 minute in-class exam sometime in October.

* **Final Exam (30%)**: 2-hour exam during the final exam period.

## Homework Policies

You will need to typeset your assignments solutions using LaTeX. Starter code
will be provided to save you time.

The purpose of homework assignments is to give you practice with the concepts,
force you think closely about the details, and receive feedback about your
progress. 

You can collaborate on your assignments, but you must submit your own work. I
encourage you to discuss the homework problems with your classmates.

You must cite all sources that you use to the complete the assignments. If you
discuss the assignment with anyone, list their name. If you refer to online
textbooks, lecture notes, etc. please include a link. If you use a LLM or AI
tool, provide a short description of what tool you used and how it helped you.

Note that really good homework exercises that help you practice with the
material are hard to come by. The exercises for this semester will be
variations of problems that I've seen before and have experience with. That
means that you will probably be able to find solutions via web search or
asking LLMs to solve the problems for you.
