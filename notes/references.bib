abstract = {In categorical semantics, there have traditionally been two approaches to modelling environments, one by use of finite products in cartesian closed categories, the other by use of the base categories of indexed categories with structure. Each requires modifications in order to account for environments in call-by-value programming languages. There have been two more general definitions along both of these lines: the first generalising from cartesian to symmetric premonoidal categories, the second generalising from indexed categories with specified structure to κ-categories. In this paper, we investigate environments in call-by-value languages by analysing a fine-grain variant of Moggi’s computational λ-calculus, giving two equivalent sound and complete classes of models: one given by closed Freyd categories, which are based on symmetric premonoidal categories, the other given by closed κ-categories.}

abstract = {Call-by-push-value (CBPV) is an idealised calculus for functional and imperative programming, introduced as a subsuming paradigm for both call-by-value (CBV) and call-by-name (CBN). We formalise weak and strong operational semantics for (effect-free) CBPV, define its equational theory, and verify adequacy for the standard set/algebra denotational semantics. Furthermore, we prove normalisation of the standard reduction, confluence of strong reduction, strong normalisation using Kripke logical relations, and soundness of the equational theory using logical equivalence. We adapt and verify the known translations from CBV and CBN into CBPV for strong reduction. This yields, for instance, proofs of strong normalisation and confluence for the full λ-calculus with sums and products. Thanks to the automation provided by Coq and the Autosubst 2 framework, there is little formalisation overhead compared to detailed paper proofs.},

abstract = {It is rare to give a semantic definition of a full-scale programming language, despite the many potential benefits. Partly this is because the available metalanguages for expressing semantics - usually either L<scp>a</scp>TEX for informal mathematics, or the formal mathematics of a proof assistant - make it much harder than necessary to work with large definitions.We present a metalanguage specifically designed for this problem, and a tool, ott, that sanity-checks such definitions and compiles them into proof assistant code for Coq, HOL, Isabelle, and (in progress) Twelf, together with L<scp>a</scp>TEX code for production-quality typesetting, and OCaml boilerplate. The main innovations are:(1) metalanguage design to make definitions concise, and easy to read and edit;(2) an expressive but intuitive metalanguage for specifying binding structures; and (3) compilation to proof assistant code.This has been tested in substantial case studies, including modular specifications of calculi from the TAPL text, a Lightweight Java with Java JSR 277/294 module system proposals, and a large fragment of OCaml (around 306 rules), with machine proofs of various soundness results. Our aim with this work is to enable a phase change: making it feasible to work routinely, without heroic effort, with rigorous semantic definitions of realistic languages.},

abstract="In spite of the popularity of small-step semantics, big-step semantics remain used by many researchers. However, big-step semantics suffer from a serious duplication problem, which appears as soon as the semantics account for exceptions and/or divergence. In particular, many premises need to be copy-pasted across several evaluation rules. This duplication problem, which is particularly visible when scaling up to full-blown languages, results in formal definitions growing far bigger than necessary. Moreover, it leads to unsatisfactory redundancy in proofs. In this paper, we address the problem by introducing pretty-big-step semantics. Pretty-big-step semantics preserve the spirit of big-step semantics, in the sense that terms are directly related to their results, but they eliminate the duplication associated with big-step semantics.",

abstract = {In ordinary lambda calculus the occurrences of a bound variable are made recognizable by the use of one and the same (otherwise irrelevant) name at all occurrences. This convention is known to cause considerable trouble in cases of substitution. In the present paper a different notational system is developed, where occurrences of variables are indicated by integers giving the “distance” to the binding λ instead of a name attached to that λ. The system is claimed to be efficient for automatic formula manipulation as well as for metalingual discussion. As an example the most essential part of a proof of the Church-Rosser theorem is presented in this namefree calculus.}

edition = {2nd},
abstract = {This text develops a comprehensive theory of programming languages based on type systems and structural operational semantics. Language concepts are precisely defined by their static and dynamic semantics, presenting the essential tools both intuitively and rigorously while relying on only elementary mathematics. These tools are used to analyze and prove properties of languages and provide the framework for combining and comparing language features. The broad range of concepts includes fundamental data types such as sums and products, polymorphic and abstract types, dynamic typing, dynamic dispatch, subtyping and refinement types, symbols and dynamic classification, parallelism and cost semantics, and concurrency and distribution. The methods are directly applicable to language implementation, to the development of logics for reasoning about programs, and to the formal verification language properties such as type safety. This thoroughly revised second edition includes exercises at the end of nearly every chapter and a new chapter on type refinements.}

The keys to our approach are (1) an adaptation of subject reduction theorems from combinatory logic to programming languages, and (2) the use of rewriting techniques for the specification of the language semantics. The approach easily extends from polymorphic functional languages to imperative languages that provide references, exceptions, continuations, and similar features. We illustrate the technique with a type soundness theorem for the core of Standard ML, which includes the first type soundness proof for polymorphic exceptions and continuations.}

abstract = {The aim of this work is largely a practical one. A widely employed style of programming, particularly in structure-processing languages which impose no discipline of types, entails defining procedures which work well on objects of a wide variety. We present a formal type discipline for such polymorphic procedures in the context of a simple programming language, and a compile time type-checking algorithm W which enforces the discipline. A Semantic Soundness Theorem (based on a formal semantics for the language) states that well-type programs cannot “go wrong” and a Syntactic Soundness Theorem states that if W accepts a program then it is well typed. We also discuss extending these results to richer languages; a type-checking algorithm based on W is in fact already implemented and working, for the metalanguage ML in the Edinburgh LCF system.}
